        Plastic kills many of our beloved sea creatures and aquatic life, on a daily basis, they are threatened by the presence of ocean pollution, the main form of this being plastic. Plastic dumped into the ocean is harming our precious aquatic life, often you will see these plastics wrapped around there necks or stuck on sea creatures such as seals or turtles. In the recent 100 years, we have produced the most plastic ever before, which ultimately means where is all this plastic going. Some of it may be recycled, but what about the rest? I'll tell you where it goes, the ocean. To put this in perspective, there is so much plastic an island called 'Plastic Island' has been named. The amount of plastic produced is not only affecting the Aquatic Life but Humanity.
